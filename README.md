# Mahanth Yalla - Blogs

This repository is a collection of my personal blogs, primarily focused on web development, programming, and technology. The blogs are written in Markdown and rendered using Hugo, a static site generator.


Thanks to the Hugo Stack Theme for providing a solid foundation for this project.[^1]
