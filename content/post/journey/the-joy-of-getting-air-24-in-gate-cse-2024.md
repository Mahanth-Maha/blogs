From Rank 186 to 𝗔𝗜𝗥 𝟮𝟰: This is my GATE Redemption Story!

Last year, I battled the GATE exam and emerged victorious... well, kind of. A rank of 186 was impressive, but it wasn't enough to secure my dream college – the prestigious 𝓘𝓘𝓢𝓬 𝓑𝓪𝓷𝓰𝓪𝓵𝓸𝓻𝓮, it wasn't even an option with my category. Dejected but not defeated, I made a decision that would change everything: 𝑎 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑖𝑐 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑝.

I was in a position with a well-paying job, comfortable routine – it all felt… okay. But, that's not how I dreamed myself. Saying goodbye to the paycheck, I dove headfirst into GATE prep. Every sunrise was a promise – my efforts wouldn't go to waste. we should think twice or thrice before keeping our efforts Because 𝘦𝘧𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘵 𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘴: 𝘕𝘰 𝘳𝘦𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘴, 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘳𝘦𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘥𝘴.

The journey wasn't without its challenges. There were moments of self-doubt, whispers of "𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜𝗙..?" echoing in my mind. But then, I'd remember the unwavering support of my incredible parents. 𝗠𝗼𝗺, your belief in me was my fuel, and 𝗗𝗮𝗱, your encouragement, my compass. This achievement is as much theirs as it is mine.

Finally, the results arrived, my heart hammered a victory march. 
 There it was, in black and bold: ＡＬＬ ＩＮＤＩＡ ＲＡＮＫ ２４. 

(also, I secured AIR 7𝟮𝟰 in GATE DA 20𝟮𝟰 , also my Favourite Movie 𝟮𝟰 , 𝙲̶𝚘̶𝚒̶𝚗̶𝚌̶𝚒̶𝚍̶𝚎̶𝚗̶𝚌̶𝚎̶ 𝓓𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓲𝓷𝔂 )

The elation was indescribable! This year, the GATE wasn't just an exam; it was a chance to rewrite my story. And guess what? 𝖨 𝖽𝗂𝖽 𝗂𝗍! , and also Yes, I have 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑡 due to the silly mistakes I made, but this time even those can't stop me either.
